                "Legend has it that the ghost always appears in a white gown with a white widow‘s veil. If she is wearing black gloves, it means bad news and most likely will be followed by a death in the Hohenzollern family.",
                "There are three possible suspects to whom the she was. The ghost was first seen before the death of Prince-elector Johann Georg in 1598. Many years before, he had promised his father, prince-elector Joachim II. on his death bed to watch over his mistress Anna Sydow. Not only did Johann Georg break that promise, he also had his father‘s concubine arrested. Anna died a horrible death in the Spandau Fortress just outside of Berlin.",
                "Other sources suggest the ghost belongs to a countess called Agnes, the wife of count Otto who both lived in the 13th or 14th century. After her husband‘s death, Agnes lived alone with her two children until she met a guy called Albrecht the Beautiful. The countess fell head over heels for the young nobleman. But he allegedly said: „I would love to marry you if is wasn‘t for those four eyes“. Assuming that Albrecht meant her children, the countess had the boy and the girl killed. Other authors suggest she even murdered them herself, getting them out of the way of her „one and only true love“. Unfortunately, Albrecht meant his own parents when he talked about „those four eyes“. He ended up marrying another woman and Agnes was left behind to pay for her sins for all eternity.",
                "Our third possibility is that the Woman in White is some kind of personified a bad conscience. Allegedly, the ghost is a woman by the name of Berta von Hohenzollern. She was married to Johann von Lichtenstein and had a tough job looking after him because Johann liked drinking and whoring like no other.  His lifestyle ultimately brought him to an early grave and on his dead bed he realized he should have listened to his wife. Berta‘s ghost appears to other members of her family as a warning.",

The yearly „Festival of Lights“ sees the two towers of the Nikolai Church bathed in white light as an homage to that story. All for nothing though: Johann Sigismund died in 1619 shortly after seeing a vision of the Woman in White. And yes, you guessed right – The lady was wearing black gloves!",

                "From the History of the Berlin Palace, Eberhard Cyran writes: „In the month of May of the 2nd year of war, the White Woman showed herself… One of Himmlers officers volunteered to stand guard and chase after the ghost. In the night from Saturday to Sunday, the 26th of May (shortly before the war with France started), a shot lit up the whole Berlin City Palace with such force that the eyes of the people standing outside started to hurt. The next morning the officer was found with a broken neck and his pistol with the safety catch off...“",

Der hatte seinem Vater Kurfürst Joachim II. auf dem Totenbett versprochen, dessen Geliebte Anna Sydow nach seinem Tod zu beschützen. Das Versprechen wurde nicht nur gebrochen, Johann Georg ließ die Konkubine seines Vaters sogar in den Kerker werfen. In der Spandauer Festung starb Anna schließlich einen elenden Tod.",

Nach dem Tod ihres Mannes blieb sie mit zwei Kindern zurück. Als sie Albrechts den Schönen, Burggraf zu Nürnberg, kennenlernte, war sie ihm in Windeseile verfallen.

                "Blöd nur, dass Albrecht der Schöne nicht von den „vier Augen“ der Kinder, sondern dem Augenpaar seiner eigenen Eltern gesprochen hatte und schließlich dennoch eine andere Frau heiratete. Die Gräfin soll nun nach ihrem Tod Buße bis in alle Ewigkeit tun.",
                "Eine dritte Legende besagt, dass die Weiße Frau eine Art personifiziertes schlechtes Gewissen sei. Es handelt sich bei dem Geist demnach um die Seele von Berta von Hohenzollern. Sie war mit Johann von Lichtenstein verheiratet und stets um dessen Wohl bemüht. Kein leichter Job, in Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass Johann gerne Weib, Wein und Gesang genoss. Sein ausschweifender Lebenswandel brachte ihm schließlich einen frühen Tod ein. Auf dem Totenbett sah er schließlich ein, dass er wohl besser auf seine Frau hätte hören sollen. Bertas Geist soll nun nach ihrem Tod den Hohenzollern als Warnung erscheinen.",

In Gedenken daran, werden die Türme der dortigen Kirche zum alljährlichen „Festival Of Lights“ mit weißem Licht angestrahlt. Geholfen hat es alles nichts: Zum Tod von Johann Sigismund im Jahr 1619 erschien die Weiße Frau dennoch in schwarzen Handschuhen.",

In der Nacht vom Sonnabend zum Sonntag, dem 26. Mai (also unmittelbar vor Kriegsbeginn in Frankreich), soll eine Kugel durch die verlassenen Räume des Hohenzollernschlosses gewandert sein - und von solcher Helligkeit, dass den Zuschauern auf dem Schlossplatz die Augen schmerzten. Am anderen Morgen soll der Offizier mit gebrochenem Genick, die entsicherte Pistole in der Hand, neben einer Treppe aufgefunden worden sein... schreibt Eberhard Cyran in seiner Geschichte des Berliner Schlosses.",
