                            "Legend has it that the ghost always appears in a white gown with a white widow‘s veil. If she is wearing black gloves, it means bad news and most likely will be followed by a death in the Hohenzollern family.",
                            "There are three possible suspects to whom the she was. The ghost was first seen before the death of Prince-elector Johann Georg in 1598. Many years before, he had promised his father, prince-elector Joachim II. on his death bed to watch over his mistress Anna Sydow. Not only did Johann Georg break that promise, he also had his father‘s concubine arrested. Anna died a horrible death in the Spandau Fortress just outside of Berlin.",
                            "Other sources suggest the ghost belongs to a countess called Agnes, the wife of count Otto who both lived in the 13th or 14th century. After her husband‘s death, Agnes lived alone with her two children until she met a guy called Albrecht the Beautiful. The countess fell head over heels for the young nobleman. But he allegedly said: „I would love to marry you if is wasn‘t for those four eyes“. Assuming that Albrecht meant her children, the countess had the boy and the girl killed. Other authors suggest she even murdered them herself, getting them out of the way of her „one and only true love“. Unfortunately, Albrecht meant his own parents when he talked about „those four eyes“. He ended up marrying another woman and Agnes was left behind to pay for her sins for all eternity.",
                            "Our third possibility is that the Woman in White is some kind of personified a bad conscience. Allegedly, the ghost is a woman by the name of Berta von Hohenzollern. She was married to Johann von Lichtenstein and had a tough job looking after him because Johann liked drinking and whoring like no other.  His lifestyle ultimately brought him to an early grave and on his dead bed he realized he should have listened to his wife. Berta‘s ghost appears to other members of her family as a warning.",
                            "Prince-elector Johann Sigismund, the grandson of Johann Georg, was so scared of the Woman in White that he sought refuge in the nearby Nikolaiviertel. The yearly „Festival of Lights“ sees the two towers of the Nikolai Church bathed in white light as an homage to that story. All for nothing though: Johann Sigismund died in 1619 shortly after seeing a vision of the Woman in White. And yes, you guessed right – The lady was wearing black gloves!",
                            "When the Woman in White doesn‘t wear her black gloves she is supposed to be rather peaceful, looking after the Palace and its residents. If, however, you provoke her, you’re in for a 'bit of bother'.",
                            "From the History of the Berlin Palace, Eberhard Cyran writes: „In the month of May of the 2nd year of war, the White Woman showed herself… One of Himmlers officers volunteered to stand guard and chase after the ghost. In the night from Saturday to Sunday, the 26th of May (shortly before the war with France started), a shot lit up the whole Berlin City Palace with such force that the eyes of the people standing outside started to hurt. The next morning the officer was found with a broken neck and his pistol with the safety catch off...“",
                            "The fate of the Woman in White is very much bound to the Palace. On January 31st 1945, three days before the Castle was bombed to the grounds, the Lady showed herself for the last time.",
                            "That is until now of course. For the last few years, the Berlin City Palace has been under reconstruction... following the original blueprints. We shall see whether the Woman in White will take up residence again when the Palace reopens. Or maybe she has never left the grounds and is standing right behind you!"
